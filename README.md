# Keybrary
The goal of Keybrary is to amass a large and varied repository of various mechanical keyboard sounds.

## Contributing
Anyone is able to add their keyboard sounds as long as they follow our format:

1. Create a folder following this naming scheme: `switch_case/kit_plate_keycaps`
2. Record a short typing test (50-100 words is acceptable) and name it `typingtest`
3. Record a soundbyte of each indiviual keypress and name it after the key. For example, position the microphone over the escape key, record, and save as `esc.mp3`
4. Create a pull request adding your folder of keyboard sounds to the appropriate folder (either linear, tactile, or clicky)

Once a pull request is placed someone with adequate permissions will review your submission and merge the pull request in if it is deemed acceptable.
